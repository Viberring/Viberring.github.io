# FP

## FP In Java
`@FunctionalInterface` note that this interface only have one method.


### lambda expression
### method reference
### functional interface
#### Consumer
```java
/**
 * Represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no
 * result. Unlike most other functional interfaces, {@code Consumer} is expected
 * to operate via side-effects.
 *
 * <p>This is a <a href="package-summary.html">functional interface</a>
 * whose functional method is {@link #accept(Object)}.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the input to the operation
 *
 * @since 1.8
 */
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Consumer<T> {

    /**
     * Performs this operation on the given argument.
     *
     * @param t the input argument
     */
    void accept(T t);

    /**
     * Returns a composed {@code Consumer} that performs, in sequence, this
     * operation followed by the {@code after} operation. If performing either
     * operation throws an exception, it is relayed to the caller of the
     * composed operation.  If performing this operation throws an exception,
     * the {@code after} operation will not be performed.
     *
     * @param after the operation to perform after this operation
     * @return a composed {@code Consumer} that performs in sequence this
     * operation followed by the {@code after} operation
     * @throws NullPointerException if {@code after} is null
     */
    default Consumer<T> andThen(Consumer<? super T> after) {
        Objects.requireNonNull(after);
        return (T t) -> { accept(t); after.accept(t); };
    }
}
```
#### Supplier
```java
/**
 * Represents a supplier of results.
 *
 * <p>There is no requirement that a new or distinct result be returned each
 * time the supplier is invoked.
 *
 * <p>This is a <a href="package-summary.html">functional interface</a>
 * whose functional method is {@link #get()}.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of results supplied by this supplier
 *
 * @since 1.8
 */
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Supplier<T> {

    /**
     * Gets a result.
     *
     * @return a result
     */
    T get();
}
```
#### Predicate
```java

/**
 * Represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of one argument.
 *
 * <p>This is a <a href="package-summary.html">functional interface</a>
 * whose functional method is {@link #test(Object)}.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of the input to the predicate
 *
 * @since 1.8
 */
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Predicate<T> {
    ...
    ...
}
```
