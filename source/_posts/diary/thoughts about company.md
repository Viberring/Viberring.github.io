# bg
    these days i was suffered with the `smell code`, which make me unacceptable. However, the company whick I work
    has a different point of view. 
    I start thinking about the relationship between me and companies.

# Profession
    I need to be professional about my job and do the professinal things about my job.
    What I only care about is the ability to tackle problems.
    I think the abilities i should have are three things:
        - master the concepts
        - practice with minds
        - communication (in-out and out-in)
## attitude
    What I should be at work ?
        finish the job that's all.
    Waht if your work is just wasting your time ?
        work hard and learn more and change you job.
## career planning
    I always want to be better and there is no end to me.
    - Be a man
## how
    - find more about yourself
    - do more 
    - fail more
