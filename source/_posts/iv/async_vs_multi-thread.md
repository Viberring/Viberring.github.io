# Async and Multi-threading
`async programming` is not the same thing
with `async io`.

## Async
`async` is comparable with `sync`.
but with `async/await`, async programming
is all about task itself.
we can achieve async with single-thread model 
or multi-threading model.

## Thread
we create a thread with a specific purpose
what we concern about is the things the thread
will do.

### What is thread

### Multi thread
multi-threading is all about concurrency and parallem execution.
multi-threading is async but with different purpose.
